The FFWD API provides a RESTful way of interacting with the FFWD website from other applications or widgets.

The API will be designed to allow developers to:

  * Make requests from our site using a standard REST-based API that returns data in either XML or JSON formats
  * Interact with your FFWD profile directly through other applications and widgets
  * Get live updates on what people are watching on FFWD

### Requirements ###

Before using our API, we require that you are an active Beta user, and that you have a valid developer API key.

If you're not already a FFWD member, you need to [sign up for a Beta account first](http://www.ffwd.com).

If you are already a member, you need to [request a developer key](http://www.ffwd.com/developers/apikey).

### Documentation ###

We currently have documentation available for version 1 (beta) of our API and will be updating it as new API features are released.

[View API Documentation](http://code.google.com/p/ffwd-api/wiki/APIDocumentation)

### Client Libraries ###

Client libraries for interacting with the API through PHP or other languages will be hosted here in the future.
